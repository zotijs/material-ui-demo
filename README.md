Playing around with Material-UI, Recharts, Nivo, Dygraphs, Leaflet and Mapbox

## Material-UI evaluation:

> - Great in customization using styles HOC or Hook
> - Great in passing theme down to children using **ThemeProvider**

## Recharts evaluation:

> - Easy to use
> - Modern UI
> - Readable properties for each Chart
> - Great in Composing different charts using **ComposedChart**
> - Based in d3
> - Big community 

## Nivo evaluation:

> - Great webpage and chart composition wizard
> - Modern UI
> - Based in d3
> - Hard to compose different charts together

## Dygraphs evaluation:

> - Lots of options
> - **Dygraph** constructor by default produces line charts
> - Needs lot of coding (custom plotters etc) in order to create other types of charts
> - Needs integration with **React**

## Leaflet with Mapbox

> - Easy to use (so far)
> - Creating layers in **Mapbox studio** and attaching theme to **Leaflet** is easy
> - Need to play around with complex examples
